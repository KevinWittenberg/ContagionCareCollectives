# ContagionCareCollectives
This project contains a replication package for a study on the diffusion of citizen collectives for health care in the Netherlands. For this study esimate spatial correlation of these care collectives, and differentiate between evidence for diffusion and spurious correlation based on spatial correlates through a data-driven approach, utilizing public administrative data.

The paper is still in development, and a full snapshot of the data and replicable code will be available upon completion. In the meantime, this page will be regularly updated with 'work in progress' versions of the code and manuscript.
